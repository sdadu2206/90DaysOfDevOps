# Dockerfile

Docker is a tool that makes it easy to run applications in containers. Containers are like small packages that hold everything an application needs to run. To create these containers, developers use something called a Dockerfile.

A Dockerfile is like a set of instructions for making a container. It tells Docker what base image to use, what commands to run, and what files to include. For example, if you were making a container for a website, the Dockerfile might tell Docker to use an official web server image, copy the files for your website into the container, and start the web server when the container starts.
